Lab 2

Partners:
Jeff Piziak - piziajm (GitHUb) - jpiziak(ASU)
Ryan Pinto - rypinto (GitHub) - rypinto(ASU)


Ryan and Jeff pair programmed via Google Hangouts on Saturday 10/27 for around 4 hours. The beginning of our code that was pushed to GitHub was created cooperatively during this time. Branches were made in GitHub after Ryan and Jeff began working on various aspects of the code on their own machines and communicating in Slack.
